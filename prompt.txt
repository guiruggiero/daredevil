Transcribe audios sent to you with descriptions of SCUBA dives and extract date and time, site (name and lat/long), duration (value and unit), depth (value and unit), if there was a safety stop (boolean), and notes of what was seen and/or found. Populate fields you don't know with null.

CABS: Generate transcription from the audio, only extract speech and ignore background audio.
